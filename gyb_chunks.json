    "content": "About the Start and Improve Y our Business (SIYB) Programme The Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) programme is a management-training programme developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) with a focus on starting and improving small businesses as a strategy for creating more and better employment for women and men, particularly in emerging economies. With an estimated outreach in over 100 countries, it is one of the world’s largest programmes in this field. The programme has four inter-related packages - Generate Your Business Idea (GYB), Start Your Business (SYB), Improve Your Business (IYB) and Expand Your Business (EYB). The ILO implements the programme using a three-tier structure comprising Master Trainers, Trainers and the end beneficiaries – potential and existing entrepreneurs. The Master Trainers licensed by the ILO are responsible for developing the capacity of the Trainers to effectively conduct SIYB training. Thereafter, the Trainers train entrepreneurs in SIYB packages. The ILO plays a critical role in identifying and disseminating best practices, carrying out trainings, monitoring activities, performing quality control and providing technical advice on the implementation of the SIYB programme. About Generate Y our Business Idea (GYB) Generate Your Business Idea (GYB) is a training programme for people who want to start a business but are not sure of the business idea to pursue. It assists potential entrepreneurs to identify different business ideas, to analyse them and select the most promising one. GYB complements ILO’s Start Your Business (SYB) training programme as a potential entrepreneur needs to have a clear idea of the business they propose to start. The GYB training course lasts approximately two – three days. The training uses an active, problem- centred learning approach which explores individual entrepreneurial potential, desire and needs through, for example, short cases and graphic illustrations."

While it sounds very tempting, being an entrepreneur also means taking on a lot of responsibilities and facing a lot of challenges! First of all, you need to find out if you are capable of running your own business. Favourable circumstances, in combination with certain personal characteristics and skills are necessary elements for your development as a successful entrepreneur. You will also need specific knowledge and experience in the field to be ultimately successful in the business you choose. Below are two assessments that you should make before going into business. The first one will measure whether you have the right abilities to be an entrepreneur. The second assessment will help you to identify which type and field of business may be suitable for you. The following assessment will help you find out if you have the basic requirements of an entrepreneur. Be honest when you answer the questions. Think about each of the following factors presented as questions. If you answer YES to the questions dealing with any particular factor, consider that factor as one of your strengths. If you answer NO to most of the questions or you are not quite sure about the answers, those factors may be areas that need improvement before you start your business."

If you are familiar with companies that make and sell their goods in bulk and you are good at establishing relationships with retailers, you may want to be a wholesaler. • Retailing Retailers purchase ready-made goods from wholesalers or suppliers for resale at a profit. Some examples of retail businesses are grocery stores, appliance stores, clothing stores, stationery shops, computer and mobile phone shops, etc. If you like meeting different people and you have access to a good location to open a shop, retailing may be a good option for you."

Your business idea Janet’s experience Janet has a small farm and her husband works in a nearby mine, but even though both of them have jobs, they do not earn enough money to pay for their children’s education. Janet decides to try and start her own business by rearing chickens to sell. She knows how to do it and her uncle gives her a loan of $400 to start the business. However, before she buys the chicks, someone tells her that there is a huge demand for sunflower oil because of its lack of availability in the market. Traders are knocking on the doors of local farmers asking them to produce it. Thinking she can earn a lot more money from pressing sunflower seeds for oil, Janet changes her business idea and starts an oil pressing venture. Janet has never grown a large quantity of sunflowers. She spends all the money from the loan to buy seeds, fertilizer and the oil pressing equipment. Since she uses most of the family farmland to grow sunflowers, there is less land to grow maize and vegetables for the family to eat. The chemicals from the fertilizer begin to make her children sick. She now has to buy more food for the family. It takes a lot of time and effort to process the oil, so, Janet has to employ someone to help her. A lot of other farmers have started growing sunflower seeds too. Therefore, by the time her oil is ready to sell, the market is already saturated with the good and Janet cannot find a buyer. To reduce her losses, Janet has to sell the oil at a very low price to a local shop. As a result, Janet makes very little money and she is not able to pay back the loan. Alex, would you buy sunflower oil from me? Thank you Janet but we have a regular supplier."

Lily’s sister-in-law came to visit and complained to Lily that she was unable to find any good clothes for her 12 year-old daughter. She said that the clothes in the stores all seem to be either made for younger children or for adults. After the visit, Lily decided to go around to the clothing shops in her town. She saw young teenage girls shopping in the stores, but she noticed that the number and variety of clothes geared to that age group was limited. She had already been thinking of quitting her job and opening her own business. Therefore, Lily decides to design some pretty clothes and dresses for young teenage girls. She makes some drawings of clothing that would appeal to that age group. She then takes her drawings to the local clothing shops, asking the owners if they would buy the dresses in the drawings, how much they would pay for them and how many they would buy. The shop owners seemed to be quite happy with her designs and said they would display her clothes. Lily then uses her savings to buy a sewing machine and some material to make her first batch. She works in the evening after getting off from work at the garment factory. All of the dresses she makes sell very well and the shops are willing to pay her in cash upon delivery. Lily then decides to quit her job to focus on her own business. Within six months, Lily starts receiving regular orders from the shops. She plans to buy one more sewing machine and hire one of her friends to work for her. Why is Lily successful in her own business? What did she do that made her successful? __________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________ Starting a business is not an easy job.

His aunt owns a successful hardware supply and rental shop, so she offered to be his financial partner and provide funds for his start-up. She does not want to be involved in the operation, but only to share the profit, while letting Hamisi run the business himself. Hamisi starts thinking about possible business ideas. He enjoys making sisal bags and wall hangings, which many of his friends admire. Therefore, at first he thinks about making and selling them to tourists as souvenirs. However, after talking to a number of local shopkeepers, he learns that there are too few tourists in his area for such a business to be profitable. Hamisi thinks about opening a gas stove shop, as he knows how to source imported gas stoves and he is familiar with the functions and quality of each brand. He does some market research and learns that there are quite a few gas stove shops in his area and their sales are low. They are offering various discount and promotional schemes, but none of their promotions have increased sales significantly. He decides that he better not enter such a tough market. Tourists would love these sisal bags, but very few of them shop here."

Everyone I talk to agrees that moving from house to house, or office to office is very difficult and time-consuming. There is no company in the area that provides packaging and moving services. Therefore, if I provide these needed services, my business will have a steady demand. • What good/service will I provide? I intend to offer complete packaging and moving services for homes and offices. Although I have no experience running this type of business, I have some experience handling, storing and transporting goods. I learned these things while working with the gas stove importing company. I can ask my brother who is very good at process management to plan the operation. In addition, I can use a reliable transportation provider who often works for my aunt’s shop. • To whom will I sell? I intend to start by offering my services to all my relatives, friends, friends of friends and my aunt’s customer base. I will then expand my business and advertise around the whole town. • How will I sell my service? I can sell my service directly to the customers. Initially, I will introduce the service to all of my friends, relatives and my aunt’s customer base. After I have done some moving for family and friends, I will expand my market and hang posters around areas where there are a lot of shops, offices, apartments and houses for rent. • How much will my business depend upon and impact the environment? My business will reuse the cartons and packaging several times so as to prevent waste."

How to identify your own list of business ideas? Now that you have read about Hamisi, see if you can find some business ideas for yourself. Every business idea should be based on knowledge of the market and its needs. The market refers to people who might want to buy a good or service; i.e. the customers. The market differs from place to place, depending on who lives in the area, how they live and for what goods or services they spend their money. When you understand the market in your area, you might recognize many business ideas that you may have previously ignored. When generating business ideas, it is best to try to keep your mind open to everything. Your first goal is to think of as many ideas as possible and make a list of all the possible business opportunities. With a list, you will have more choices! You then can scan the list and nail down the idea(s) that sound most feasible to you and that you think will be most profitable. There are many ways to come up with business ideas, such as surveying local businesses or asking existing business owners. Below, we will examine a few different approaches to generating business ideas. The information gained from one approach may supplement another and help you to clearly describe your business ideas. Write down your business ideas on an idea list using the different approaches to find new ideas (see the following example)."

Hamisi started his business in 2009 when he needed to earn extra income. While helping his aunt move to a new house, he found that moving was a very big job and that there was no packaging and moving company in his area. Also, he had some experience in handling, storing and transporting goods that he had gained while working with a gas stove importing company. Why did the owner think it was a good idea to start that kind of business? Hamisi did some market research and learned that a considerable number of people in his area move their homes and offices frequently. They all complain that moving is a formidable task and that there is no packaging and moving service in town to assist them. How did the owner find out what his potential customers wanted? Hamisi talked to lots of friends, relatives, owners of businesses and neighbours. What strengths or assets did the owner use to start this business? (E.g., previous experience, training, social networks, contacts, hobbies) Hamisi had an aunt who was in business and was willing to assist him to finance his business. He had gained experience in packing, storing and transporting goods in his previous job. He also had a brother who helped him organize the operation. What problems did the owner face while setting up the business? Hamisi did not know much about marketing, so it was initially difficult for him to get the word out about his unique service. Has the business good or service changed over time? The business has expanded. He now has his own van and is planning to buy two more vans and to employ more staff next year. What is the impact of the business on the natural environment and the community? Hamisi reuses the packaging cartons and materials at least two or three times before selling them to his local recycling centre. Therefore, he not only saves costs but also reduces waste. (People who do their own packaging and moving often throw away the packaging materials afterwards.) His business provides employment to people in his community. People with lower education are also able to get a job in his business as he assigns basic tasks to them."

Find out what type of businesses are already operating in your area and see if you can identify any gaps in the market. If you live in a village or small town, you may be able to identify all the fields of business in the whole town. Otherwise, you may need to focus on the preferred business fields and business types that you identified in Part I of the manual.

Think about the possible use of waste materials for the production of other useful and marketable items. Recyclable waste products can be identified by analysing certain items to see how they are discarded. Man-made waste has a detrimental effect on the environment. In most cases, companies are keen to work with entrepreneurs who can turn their waste products into valuable and marketable items. Usually there is something that can be reused in things that we throw away. Recycling may be done with waste products that come from agricultural processing, household garbage, used machinery and appliances or industrial waste. People throw out food that could be used to make compost or animal feed. They also throw away paper, glass and aluminium that can be recycled. Think of things that can be made from what others thought was garbage. Many industries dispose of useful materials. A clothing company might throw out small pieces of cloth that could be used to make something else. Plastics factories usually have materials left over that might be useful for insulation, stuffing for pillows or a new kind of fuel."

You start with a word or a topic and then write down everything that comes to mind relating to that subject. You continue writing for as long as possible, putting down things that you think of, even if they seem irrelevant or odd. Good ideas can come from concepts that initially seem strange. Brainstorming works best in a group. Get your family or friends together and ask them to help by writing down ideas they have when they hear the word or subject matter. We will use Ken as an example. He asked his sister and two friends to brainstorm with him to find a business idea. He has worked as a carpenter in a furniture factory for a long time so they started with the word “wood” . At first the ideas for businesses related to wood came slowly. But soon they had many possibilities."

However, when considering the following five criteria, her list has been reduced to only six ideas. • Which need is to be fulfilled? • What good or service will the business sell? • Who will the business sell to? • How will the business sell its good or service? • How much will the business depend upon and impact the environment? These six on her short list are now the best ideas that she will consider. MY IdEAS LIST Ideas description Solar lamps and chargers Which need is to be fulfilled? Need for lighting in areas where the electricity is unreliable, expensive and the power is often cut. What good/service? Solar lamps and chargers. There is an NGO currently t eaching people how to make solar lighting and chargers. There is also a programme for financing businesses that produce solar products. Who to sell to? All the homes and businesses in my area, as the power here is often cut off. How to sell? Through hardware stores. How will the environment be affected? The lamp uses solar energy, a form of renewable energy. The charger will be durable so that it has a long life and does not need to be replaced often. Dumping of chargers that have toxic chemicals inside will be done in such a way that does not pollute the environment or seep into the water table."

No one else in town does this. What good/ service? Delivery of lunch boxes. I know how to cook and I enjoy it. Not much money is needed to start. Who to sell to? Office workers in the city centre. How to sell? By providing a phone number for people to call in the morning and order one of the four lunch sets available every day. How will the environment be affected? Disposable styrofoam containers are difficult to eliminate and are not environmentally-friendly. Paper is better, but it still requires wood from trees, which contributes to degradation of the forests. I would rather use reusable containers; however it is a bit difficult to collect them after lunch every day. A tile-making business Which need is to be fulfilled? A lot of people in this town are building houses and need tiles. There is no other business manufacturing tiles in this town, so all the retailers buy from a tile factory in another area. What good/service? Tiles. The local clay is good for making tiles and, is plentiful and cheap. I do not know how to make tiles but they are beautiful and I would enjoy learning. The equipment would be expensive. Who to sell to? Retailers in the area who are buying tiles from the factories in other localities. But the problem is that I am not sure how many customers there will be or if I could make tiles that are as high quality as those produced in the factories. How to sell? Through the construction material retailers in the area. How will the environment be affected? Making clay tiles is not harmful to the environment. Second-hand clothing store Which need is to be fulfilled? There are lots of people who want nice clothing but cannot afford to buy new clothes. What good/service? A second-hand clothing store. There is no similar shop in town. I would be careful to buy used clothing that is fashionable and sell it at a price well below the prices in the local clothing stores. I once worked in a clothing store. I have a good eye for fashion and I know how to recognize good quality clothes. I would really enjoy running a shop, meeting people and selling fashionable clothing. Who to sell to? Low income families and students on a tight budget. How to sell? I will rent a shop space in the centre of town. I need to find out how much it will cost to rent a space. How will the environment be affected? This is a business that recycles clothing, so it is good for the environment. My business relies on a good supply of second-hand clothes."

There is a need for home-based hospice or medical care, as the local hospitals are very busy and do not provide hospice care for terminally ill patients. There is no business like this in this town. The community really needs this type of service as a lot of people have to work and have no time to look after their sick relatives. What good/ service? A service that provides home-based care. I have often looked after sick people. Also, my sister is a nurse and she could help me. I could get into a medical aid scheme or work with a donor financed NGO to source financing to care for those who are unable to pay for the service. Many women in my community could be employed to provide this service. I would enjoy this work as I like to help other people. Who to sell to? Families with elderly and/or sick people. How to sell? I would open an agency office and advertise my service in local newspapers, on the internet and through the local doctors and hospitals. How will environment be affected? The community would welcome this service as it is an ethical business that helps those in need. Garbage collection Which need is to be fulfilled? Many people complain that they do not know where to dump their garbage and that the municipal government does not provide a regular, frequent collection service. It also does not have a landfill site that is open to the public so that people can dispose of their trash. What good/ service? A garbage collection service. Besides providing a badly needed service and collecting money for it, there is additional revenue that can be made from recycling products such as plastics, metals, paper and textiles. Perhaps the municipal government would give me a contract. A friend used to work in the department responsible for garbage collection so he could advise me. Who to sell to? We would be providing a community service, so there should be lots of customers willing to pay something to get rid of the garbage. Once we have a landfill site and have purchased trucks to pick up garbage, we would set up accounts for every home and business in the area and connect with companies that recycle waste to buy the recyclable materials from us. How to sell? Direct collection. Start-up capital for vehicles and drivers would be needed. There is however, a push cart that the local environmental conservation NGO has been promoting that can be used for collecting household garbage. I could also start small by using the push cart and working with a team of unemployed youth in the community to start providing the service and then expand the business as money comes in to buy garbage collection trucks. How will the environment be affected? This service helps clean up the environment."

To answer these questions objectively, you should get more information by doing a field study. 2. Field study By talking to possible future customers or suppliers and to members of the business community, you can gather useful information about the factors that would affect your business idea. You could just have informal discussions and make observations or you could arrange more formal visits and interviews. The visits will take time and effort, but by doing field research, you would already be starting to act like a successful businessperson. The contacts you make during these visits would also be useful when you start your business. Collecting information for your business gives you an opportunity to promote your business idea and to present yourself as a potential entrepreneur. Describe your idea positively and explain why you think it will be something customers want. Talk about how your idea will contribute positively to the development of your community.

For example, an idea may be received well by potential customers and may have very little competition in the marketplace, but may need a huge initial capital investment. On the other hand, there might be a business idea that is popular with potential customers, but that has some competition and needs less initial investment. Therefore, the second idea might be more feasible if you do not have access to a large amount of money. Make note of the three ideas that meet all the criteria and would offer the best potential. Once you have reduced your list of business ideas to the three that are most suitable, the next step is to use a SWOT analysis tool to select the best idea out of the three. 3. SWOT analysis One method people often use to decide the most suitable business idea is a SWOT analysis. It helps you to focus on the possible problem areas and the potential advantages of each idea.

Strengths are the specific positive aspects which will give your proposed business an advantage over similar business ventures and the competitors. It could be that you propose to sell a better quality product or that you have a location which is more accessible to your customers. There will always be demand for new products that offer new ways of solving old problems or are more efficient than other products. Could your good or service benefit from having a Fair Trade or Organic Product certificate? Customers are inclined to pay higher prices for Fair Trade or Organic Products. Weaknesses are the things that your business will not do as well as other businesses. Perhaps your costs will be higher because your business is located a long way from the source of supplies needed for production and you will have to pay more for transport or perhaps you are unable to meet the quality standards of the competition."

What aspects of the environment will benefit the business and what aspects will negatively affect the business? Opportunities are on-going potential developments that will be good for your business. It could be that the demand for the product you are proposing will increase because of an influx of tourists. It could also be that new regulations enacted by the government for the promotion of green jobs and social enterprises will result in a higher demand for the type of products that you will provide. Threats are events that may negatively affect your business. For example, the business idea could be so simple that other people may start similar businesses in your area and reduce your share of the market. There could also be proposed legislation affecting the operation of your business, such as restrictions on the import of certain products. Once you have identified your SWOT, try matching your Strengths and Opportunities to ascertain whether or not they will give your business an advantage. For example, if people are looking for a service that matches your proposed product (Opportunities) and you are very service oriented and care about details (Strengths), you may be creating a big advantage for your proposed business. You may also match your Weaknesses and Threats to determine if you can improve your weak points to cope with the threats. On the other hand, if the two present a major obstacle to the potential for profit, you may consider deleting that business idea."

She also thinks that she is more interested in that idea, as it fits well with her love of fashion. She decides to choose the second-hand clothing store as her business. Now do a SWOT analysis for each of the three business ideas you have selected. First make three copies of the SWOT analysis form as shown on the next page and then write down the first of your three selected business ideas on the first form. Think carefully about the strengths and weaknesses within the business. These may be personal characteristics, financial issues, marketing issues, the location of the business or the cost of promoting and selling your product. Write all of them down. Think of the external environment for this business. What are the opportunities and threats in your business environment? The “key informants” you spoke to during your field research may have pointed these out to you. Write them down."
